# student-scholarship-placement-eligibility-system-python

1. **Project Overview**

This project is part of my AI Powered Python Course, where I focused on building
logic-driven systems that reflect real-world decision-making.

2. The system evaluates whether a student is eligible for:

~ Scholarships

~ Placement opportunities

based on multiple academic and skill-related conditions.

3. **Problem Statement**

Educational institutions often rely on manual checks to determine student eligibility,
which can be inefficient and inconsistent.

Objective:

Build an automated Python-based eligibility system using conditional logic.

4. **Approach & Logic**

~ Implemented Nested IF conditions

~ Used logical & relational operators

~ Converted real eligibility rules into executable Python logic

~ Designed the system to handle multiple decision paths

5. **Tools & Concepts Used**

~ Python Programming

~ Nested IF Statements

~ Logical Operators

~ Conditional Decision-Making

~ Problem-Solving Techniques

6. **Key Learnings**

~ Writing clean and readable conditional logic

~ Translating business rules into Python code

~ Developing analytical thinking required for a Data Analyst role

~ Understanding how rule-based systems work in real applications

7. **Future Improvements**

~ Integrate real student datasets

~ Convert logic into functions

~ Extend system using Pandas for data analysis

~ Add visualization for eligibility insights
